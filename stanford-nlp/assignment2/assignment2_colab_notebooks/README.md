# Notes on Colab Notebooks

All of the ipython notebooks are in Google Colab. To make edits to the code, go to the link at the top which says "Open in Colab".

### Instructions on making edits:
- Click on the link to "Open in Colab" in order to edit or make changes to the code.
- If you want to save the changes, you can save it to Github and/ or save it in your drive.
- Changes to code in Colab take some time to register. If you save changes but don't see them immediately in Github, or you don't see your changes when you open the notebook again, wait about 5-10 minutes. They should be there.
